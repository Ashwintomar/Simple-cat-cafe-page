# Simple-cat-cafe-page
This is a basic front page for an imaginary cat cafe site.
All the required files are provided in folders.
This is a non-responsive basic test page I made to start with web development.

Files included:

-index HTML file

-style CSS file

-images folder with used images

-audio folder with background sound for site.

if something is missing, site may show missing elements.
